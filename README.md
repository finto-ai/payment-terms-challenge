# Payment Terms Challenge

A Node.js CLI application (TypeScript) that extracts payment terms and key invoice data from markdown invoices using OpenAI's GPT-5 model.

## üéØ Challenge Task

Your task is to extend the existing invoice extraction schema to capture more detailed information from invoices.

### Current Schema (Simplified)

The current implementation extracts only basic header information:
- Invoice number
- Invoice date
- Due date
- Payment terms (as text)
- Total amount
- Currency

### Your Goal

Extend the schema in `src/schema.ts` to extract:

1. **Invoice Header** (already implemented, but feel free to add more fields):
   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Due date
   - Currency
   - Total amount

2. **Line Items** (needs to be added):
   Each line item should include:
   - `description` - Item description
   - `quantity` - Quantity ordered
   - `unitPrice` - Price per unit
   - `lineTotal` - Total for this line
   - `isDiscountEligible` - Whether this line is eligible for early payment discounts (important for surcharges!)
   - Any other relevant fields you identify

3. **Payment Terms** (needs to be structured):
   Most invoices have two payment options:

   **a) Net Payment Term:**
   - `netDays` - Number of days until payment is due (e.g., 30)
   - `netDueDate` - Specific due date

   **b) Discount Payment Term(s):**
   - `discountPercentage` - Discount percentage (e.g., 2.5%)
   - `discountDays` - Days within which discount applies (e.g., 10)
   - `discountDueDate` - Specific date for discount eligibility
   - `discountAmount` - Calculated discount amount in currency
   - `discountBase` - Amount on which discount is calculated (may differ from total if surcharges excluded)

   **Important:** Calculate the discount amounts **per line item** based on whether each item is discount-eligible. Some charges (surcharges, delivery, energy costs) should be marked as `isDiscountEligible: false`.

### Edge Cases to Handle

The invoices include several real-world scenarios that your schema must handle:

**invoice7**: Copper surcharges excluded from early payment discount
- Copper surcharge line should have `isDiscountEligible: false`
- Discount calculation should only apply to eligible items
- Total discount: 2.5% on ‚Ç¨1,460.00 = ‚Ç¨36.50 (not on full ‚Ç¨1,647.50)

**invoice8**: Multiple excluded charges (copper surcharge + freight & packaging)
- Both copper surcharge and freight lines marked as non-eligible
- 3% discount on ‚Ç¨1,513.50 (not on ‚Ç¨1,723.30)

**invoice9**: Delivery charges excluded from discount calculation
- Delivery line item should be `isDiscountEligible: false`
- 2% discount on goods value only

**invoice10**: Energy surcharges and special delivery excluded
- Energy surcharge and special delivery marked as non-eligible
- 2.5% discount within 10 days on materials only

Your schema should clearly distinguish eligible vs. non-eligible line items and calculate discounts accordingly.

### Required Output Fields

Your schema must include:

**Invoice Header:**
- Invoice number, date, due date, currency, total amount (already implemented)

**Line Items Array:**
- Each line item must have: description, quantity, unit price, line total
- **Critical:** `isDiscountEligible` boolean flag (to identify surcharges/delivery/energy costs)

**Structured Payment Terms:**
- Must extract **both** payment options (net and discount)
- **Net terms:** Include both the number of days (e.g., 30) AND the specific due date
- **Discount terms:** Must include ALL of the following:
  - Discount percentage (e.g., 2.5%)
  - Discount days (e.g., 10)
  - Discount due date (specific date for discount eligibility)
  - Discount amount (calculated in currency)
  - Discount base amount (may differ from total when items are excluded)

### What We're Looking For

- Clean, well-structured Zod schemas with appropriate nesting
- Proper handling of nullable/optional fields
- Clear field naming and types
- Correct calculation of discount amounts based on line-item eligibility
- Ability to handle edge cases where certain charges are excluded from discounts
- Per-line-item discount eligibility tracking (`isDiscountEligible` field)
- Structured payment terms (not just text) with ALL required fields (days, dates, amounts, percentages)
- Code quality and TypeScript best practices

**Note:** Part of this challenge is designing an appropriate schema structure. Think about how to best model payment terms with nested objects.

### Submission

When you're done:
1. Test your solution with all invoices (`invoice1` through `invoice10`)
2. Review the JSON output in the `output/` folder
3. Ensure edge cases are handled correctly

No need to modify the prompt engineering or OpenAI integration - focus on the schema design!

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- pnpm
- A valid OpenAI API key with access to GPT-5

## Available Test Invoices

**Standard invoices:** `invoice1` through `invoice6`
Basic invoices with straightforward payment terms.

**Edge case invoices (test these!)**:
- `invoice7` - Copper surcharges excluded from early payment discount
- `invoice8` - Multiple excluded charges (copper surcharge + freight & packaging)
- `invoice9` - Delivery charges excluded from discount calculation
- `invoice10` - Energy surcharges and special delivery costs excluded from discount

### Example Usage

```bash
# Test with a standard invoice
pnpm run extract invoice1

# Test with edge cases
pnpm run extract invoice7
pnpm run extract invoice8

# Check the output
cat output/invoice7.json
```

## Tips

- The project uses `tsx` for fast TypeScript execution (no build needed during development)
- Run `pnpm run lint` to check for TypeScript errors
- The prompt is in `src/prompt.ts` - you don't need to modify it
- Focus on the schema design in `src/schema.ts`
- Test frequently with different invoices to validate your schema

## Current Output Schema (Starter Code)

The current implementation in `src/schema.ts` is intentionally minimal:

```typescript
{
  invoiceNumber: string | null;
  invoiceDate: string | null;
  dueDate: string | null;
  paymentTerms: string | null;  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Just text - you need to structure this!
  totalAmount: number | null;
  currency: string | null;
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: lineItems array
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: structured payment terms with discount calculations
}
```

**Your task:** Extend this schema to match the requirements above.

Results are saved to `output/<invoice-name>.json` and printed to stdout.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or create .env file: cp .env.example .env

# 3. Test the current implementation
pnpm run extract invoice1

# 4. Start working on your solution
# - Edit src/schema.ts to extend the schema
# - Test with: pnpm run extract invoice7 (edge case)
# - Review output in output/invoice7.json
```
